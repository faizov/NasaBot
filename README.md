# NasaBot
Bot NASA

My small pet project using NASA API api.nasa.gov.

At the moment, I have implemented a telegram bot in which you can get a Photo of the day, a random photo of the day, setting up a delayed publication of the photo of the day. Getting a random photo from Mars from Curiosity.

There is also a bot for vk, which once an hour will send a random photo from Curiosity to the group.
